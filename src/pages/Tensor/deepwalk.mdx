# Tensor.deepwalk()

Returns a list of all the tensors in the graph that are reachable from the current tensor.

## Usage
```python copy
from tinygrad.tensor import Tensor

out = Tensor([1, 2, 3, 4])
y = Tensor([1, 2, 3, 4])

loss = out.mul(y).mean()

loss = loss.deepwalk()

print(loss)
```

## Return value
```bash
[]
```
