# Tensor.full_like()

Creates a tensor with the same shape and type (unless a new type is provided) as a given tensor, filled with fill_value.

## Usage

```python copy
from tinygrad.tensor import Tensor

tensor = Tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

x = Tensor.full_like(tensor, 5)

print(x.numpy())
```

## Return value

```bash
[[5. 5.]
 [5. 5.]]
```
