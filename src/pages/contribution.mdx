# Contribution

There has been a lot of interest in tinygrad lately. Here are some basic guidelines for contributing:

- Bug fixes are the best and always welcome! Like [this one](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad/pull/421/files).
- If you don't understand the code you are changing, don't change it!
- All code golf PRs will be closed, but [conceptual cleanups](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad/pull/372/files) are great.
- Features are welcome. Though if you are adding a feature, you need to include tests.
- Improving test coverage is great, with reliable non-brittle tests. 

Additional guidelines can be found in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
