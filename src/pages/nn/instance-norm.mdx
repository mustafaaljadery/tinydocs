# InstanceNorm

Applies Instance Normalization over a 4D input (a mini-batch of 2D inputs with additional channel dimension) as described in the paper [Instance Normalization: The Missing Ingredient for Fast Stylization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08022).

## Usage
```python copy
from tinygrad.nn import InstanceNorm 

N, C, H, W = 20, 5, 10, 10

layer = InstanceNorm(C)
```

## Arguments

### num_features

The number of channels or the number of features of the input tensor.

### eps (default: 1e-5)

The epsilon value to avoid division by zero.

### affine (default: True)

The flag indicating whether to apply the affine transformation or not.
