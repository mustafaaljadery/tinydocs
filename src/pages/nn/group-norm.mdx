# GroupNorm

Applies Group Normalization over a mini-batch of inputs as described in the paper [Group Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08494).

## Usage
```python copy
from tinygrad.nn import GroupNorm

BS, H, W, C, G = 20, 10, 10, 6, 3

layer = GroupNorm(G, C)
```

## Arguments

### num_groups

The number of groups to separate the channels into. Each group will be normalized separately. Must be a divisor of the number of channels in the input.

### num_channels

The number of channels expected in input. The input should have `num_channels` from an expected input of size `batch_size x num_channels [x d1 [x ... [x dk]]]`.

### eps (default: 1e-5)

The epsilon value added for numerical stability.

### affine (default: True)

The affine flag. If True, this module has learnable per-element affine parameters initialized to ones (for weights) and zeros (for biases).
