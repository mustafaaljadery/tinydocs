# tinygrad

The goal of tinygrad is to make the simplest machine learning framework there is.

Due to its extreme simplicity, it aims to be the easiest framework to add new accelerators to, with support for both inference and training. If XLA is CISC, tinygrad is RISC.

## Features

### LLaMA and Stable Diffusion

tinygrad can run [LLaMA](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad/blob/master/docs/showcase.md#llama) and [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad/blob/master/docs/showcase.md#stable-diffusion)!

### Laziness

Try a matmul. See how, despite the style, it is fused into one kernel with the power of laziness.

```bash copy
DEBUG=3 python3 -c "from tinygrad.tensor import Tensor;
N = 1024; a, b = Tensor.rand(N, N), Tensor.rand(N, N);
c = (a.reshape(N, 1, N) * b.permute(1,0).reshape(1, N, N)).sum(axis=2);
print((c.numpy() - (a.numpy() @ b.numpy())).mean())"
```

Change `DEBUG` to `4` to see the generated code.

### Neural networks

As it turns out, 90% of what you need for neural networks are a decent autograd/tensor library. Throw in an optimizer, a data loader, and some compute, and you have all you need.

**Neural network example (from test/models/test_mnist.py)**
```python copy
from tinygrad.tensor import Tensor
import tinygrad.nn.optim as optim

class TinyBobNet:
  def __init__(self):
    self.l1 = Tensor.uniform(784, 128)
    self.l2 = Tensor.uniform(128, 10)

  def forward(self, x):
    return x.dot(self.l1).relu().dot(self.l2).log_softmax()

model = TinyBobNet()
optim = optim.SGD([model.l1, model.l2], lr=0.001)

# ... complete data loader here

out = model.forward(x)
loss = out.mul(y).mean()
optim.zero_grad()
loss.backward()
optim.step()
```

## Accelerators

tinygrad already supports numerous accelerators, including:

<br/>

- [X] CPU
- [X] CPU
- [X] GPU (OpenCL)
- [X] C Code (Clang)
- [X] LLVM
- [X] METAL
- [X] CUDA
- [X] Triton
- [X] PyTorch
- [X] HIP
- [X] WebGPU

And it is easy to add more! Your accelerator of choice only needs to support a total of 26 (optionally 27) low level ops. More information can be found in the [documentation for adding new accelerators](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad/blob/master/docs/adding_new_accelerators.md).
